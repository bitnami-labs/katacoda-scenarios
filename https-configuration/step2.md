To generate and use a new SSL certificate for your domain, you have three options:

* You can use a Let's Encrypt certificate (free, requires renewal every 90 days)
* You can use a new self-signed certificate (free).
* You can use a certificate verified by a third-party Certificate Authority (CA) (typically on payment of a fee). 

Proceed to Step 3 for instructions on the first option, or to Step 4 for instructions on the second and third option.
