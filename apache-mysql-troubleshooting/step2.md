Use the command below to access the script again:

`curl http://localhost/example.php`{{execute}}

The script now displays an error message related to the database. To locate and resolve the error, follow the steps below: 

1. Check the MySQL error log:

    `sudo tail /opt/bitnami/mysql/data/mysqld.log`{{execute}}

    You will see that the error relates to the access credentials used by the PHP script to connect to the MySQL database.

2. Check the PHP script:

    `sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache2/htdocs/example.php`{{execute}}

    Update the password on line 6 to `mypass` and save the file. 

Continue to the next step to see if this resolves the error.
